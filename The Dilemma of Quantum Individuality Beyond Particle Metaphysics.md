Thoughts:

## We cannot know *what* the quantum element is.
Two further thoughts about this:
- This could be due to the fact that as prime matter, the quantum element lacks all form and therefore has no essence, and its nature is totally potential
- This is also similar to Aquinas' thought that we cannot know what God is because we do not know what his essence is.
	- Which requires not a demonstration *propter quid* -- arguing from cause to effect --, but rather a demonstration *quia* -- arguing from effect to cause.
	- The reason it is similar is because we are far from the realm of everyday experience.

## On indistinguishability

Hylemorphic interpretation would expect this:
1. Quantum elements are merely potentia as prime matter
2. Matter is the principle of individuation
3. Iff two elements are distinguishable (in principle), one element must have some property the other lacks.
4. But as totally potential, neither have actual properties, but rather share the same capabilities or powers
5. Hence quantum elements should not be distinguishable.

We can weaken (4) by allowing the elements to have shared actual properties, such as charge, mass, or spin. These are obvious intensive properties.

If this is true, whence comes the spin statistics theorem? This may be explained by invoking Lorentz symmetry.
